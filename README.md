This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving raw pointers and memory safety. The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to modify a vector's elements through a raw pointer. This approach leads to undefined behavior because the vector might reallocate its internal memory. The `bugSolution.rs` file offers a safe alternative using the vector's indexing capabilities or borrowing methods to avoid such pitfalls.
